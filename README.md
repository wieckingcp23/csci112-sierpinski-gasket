## Description
This project was my submission for the final lab assignment in **CSCI 112: Data Structures**. The task was to implement recursion to generate a **Sierpiński gasket**, a well-known fractal pattern  

The program relies on the `ezgraphics.py` library for rendering the graphical output

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- `ezgraphics.py` (must be available in the project directory or installed)

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wieckingcp23/gasket.git
   cd gasket
   ```
2. Ensure that ezgraphics.py is available
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python gasket.py
   ```
---
## Example Output
A generated Sierpiński gasket appears as a recursive triangular fractal

---
## Notes
- This project demonstrates the use of recursion in Python for graphical output
- It was completed as an academic exercise and is not actively maintained
