## Description
This project was my submission for the final lab assignment in **CSCI 112: Data Structures**. The task was to implement recursion to generate a **Sierpi≈Ñski gasket**, a well-known fractal pattern.  

The program relies on the `ezgraphics.py` library for rendering the graphical output.
